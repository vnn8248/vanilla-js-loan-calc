# vanilla-js-loan-calc

This is a simple loan calculator that practices manipulating the DOM.

## Front-end
Bootstrap styles are used for this project. An event is added to the submit button. When fired a loading gif will display for a timeout of 2 seconds. This is purely for user experience. The results of the loan calculation will subsequently display after the loading gif times out. All of the loan calculations were taken from online resouces. 

## Live server
VS Code extension Live Server was added. The server is launched from the index.html file and will auto-refresh on each save in VS code.
